#summary I am tired of heavy, clunky web based file managers; so I am building my own.  Main goal is to unpack compressed files on the server for you.

= Introduction =

BDZipper is a web-based file control application.  The end goal is for me to be able to deploy applications on shared hosts, especially unzipping.

= Details =

  * My only caveat is it's being build using .NET 3.5 instead of 2.0.  My reason, I figure by the time I have a decent working copy available, most hosts will be supporting it.  :)

== Features ==
  * Simple interface which allows you easy navigation through directory structure.
  * NO DIRECTORY TREE VIEWS; can't stand them, not going to use them
  * SQLite for security and any other database needs which crop up.
  * Drop-in deployment, period.
  * Unpack compressed files, first release will be .zip, .rar, and .gz
  * edit text files (FCKEditor)
